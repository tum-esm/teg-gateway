# Summary

The TEG-Gateway is a lightweight, general-purpose open source software built for managing and monitoring networks of IoT devices. 
It is built to integrate with the ThingsBoard platform and was designed specifically for operating distributed 
sensor networks for scientific research. 
Originally developed for and validated in the ACROPOLIS sensor network, it is network-agnostic and can be used with a wide range of IoT and sensor hardware.
The TEG-Gateway offers a stable and reusable architectural baseline for scientific sensor networks, enabling researchers to focus on application-specific logic while relying on a proven gateway design for communication, data persistence, and remote management. 
It is designed to be robust against network and power outages, crashes, and other failures, thus reducing the risk of data loss, system downtime, or the need for physical intervention. 
Hardware interfacing logic is delegated to a user-defined controller software which interacts with the TEG-Gateway via a message queue, separating infrastructure and application logic.


~~- Introduce the TEG-Gateway as reusable research software
- Describe it as a lightweight gateway for scientific sensor networks ("The software must have an obvious research application.")
- Emphasize separation of infrastructure and application logic
- Highlight controller-agnostic design and reuse across projects
- Reference validation in a real-world scientific deployment~~

# Statement of need

Sensor networks are a critical tool for scientific research across disciplines, enabling long-term, continuous measurements in environments that are often difficult to access.
However, deploying and maintaining these networks can be challenging due to limited physical access, unreliable network connectivity, and the need for robust data management and remote configuration capabilities. Especially a growing number of devices increase the time effot that needs to be invested by the operator in network administration and system monitoring.
While sensor hardware and acquisition protocols can vary widely across projects, the underlying infrastructure needs for reliable bidirectional communication, persistent data buffering, remote management, reliable software updates over the air, and failure recovery without physical access are largely consistent. 
A reusable architectural baseline for scientific sensor networks can reduce duplicated engineering effort, allowing researchers to focus on application-specific logic and deploy new sensor networks more rapidly. 
The TEG-Gateway fills exactly that need by providing a stable and reusable gateway architecture that integrates with the ThingsBoard platform.
Last but not least the TEG-Gateway offers architectural consistency across scientific projects within the same research group and can be reused beyond a single study or funding cycle, thus maximizing the impact of the software and the research it supports.

~~- Scientific sensor networks are widely used across disciplines
- Typical use cases include long-term, continuous measurements
- Deployments often operate unattended for months or years
- Physical access to devices is limited or costly
- Network connectivity can be intermittent or unreliable~~

~~- Sensor networks differ mainly in:
  - sensor hardware
  - acquisition protocols
  - domain-specific processing~~
~~- Infrastructure needs are largely identical across projects
  - Reliable bidirectional communication with a central platform
  - Local buffering of data during network outages
  - Remote configuration and maintenance capabilities
  - Safe software updates without disrupting measurements
  - Ability to recover from failures without physical intervention~~
~~- A reusable architectural baseline reduces duplicated engineering effort~~

~~- Research projects can:
  - Start from a proven gateway design
  - Implement only controller logic specific to their hardware
  - Reduce engineering overhead at project start
  - Deploy new sensor networks more rapidly~~

~~- The ThingsBoard Edge Gateway provides:
  - A stable and reusable gateway architecture
  - (Clear separation between infrastructure and application logic)
  - (Persistent connectivity, buffering, and remote management)
  - (Supervision of an external, application-specific controller)~~

~~- Broader impact:
  - Architectural consistency across scientific projects (setup thingsboard once, deploy many times)
  - Reuse beyond a single study or funding cycle~~

# State of the Field

Main difference to others. We integrate the gateway in the edge device. This allows to deploy single devices at different locations without the need of a on location mist/fog gateway.

# Software Design

- Two-component architecture:
  - Edge Gateway (this software)
  - Controller Software (project-specific, we provide an example implementation)
- Good Scaling properties (ThingsBoard):
  - Controllers can be added or removed from the network as needed
- TEG-Gateway functionality:
  - MQTT-based communication with ThingsBoard
  - Tiered local buffering of telemetry, logs, and historical data
  - Server-authoritative remote file management and mirroring
  - Remote procedure calls for operational control
  - Controller-only over-the-air (OTA) updates using Git
  - Rollback to previous controller versions
  - Self-provisioning against ThingsBoard
  - Automated health monitoring and diagnostic telemetry
  - Graceful handling of network outages and controller failures
- Controller responsibilities:
  - Sensor/Actuator hardware interaction
  - Data acquisition and processing
- Controller is managed as a Docker container
- Architecture supports continuous gateway availability, regardless of the state of the controller software
- Architecture is designed to be robust against crashes, network outages, and other failures

## Implementation

- Implemented in Python (version 3.12+)
- Modular code structure separating communication, persistence, and operational logic
- Tiered persistence using specialized SQLite databases for communication, archiving, and logging
- SQLite-based inter-process communication (IPC) for controller-gateway interaction
- Docker used for controller isolation
- Git used for versioned controller repository management and OTA updates
- Static type checking using mypy
- Documentation generated using Sphinx
